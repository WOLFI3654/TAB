## Introduction  
Here it is. After countless requests to go opensource, I did it to make those people quiet. It worked.  
It's already been a year and I still can't see any positives of it. This way I just made it easier for everyone to make a plugin as good, so people can stop using it and switch to something better. 
  
  
## Compiling
Plugin can be compiled using maven.

  
## Premium code
The source contains content of premium version as well. However, this must be activated by setting [this line to return true](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/blob/master/src/main/java/me/neznamy/tab/shared/TAB.java#L79).
